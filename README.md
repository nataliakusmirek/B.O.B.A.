# B.O.B.A.
After many discord music bots being shut down this past month, I decided to make a **discord music bot** for my friends and I to use in voice channels.

This bot is hosted through Replit and UptimeRobot at the moment, meaning it can be used 24/7.

A few of the commands include:
-play
-stop
-pause
-resume
-join
-disconnect
-credits [and a few custom commands to play certain songs!]
